PortfolioItem-BulkStateChanger
=========================

## Overview
The State of a PortfolioItem is itself an Object. This difference in design means the standard Custom Grid can't bulk update the State of PortfolioItems. This app provides a simple grid that allows bulk changes of PortfolioItem State.
